<h1 align = "center"> --- CALCULATOR ---</h1>
<p></p><h3>Design a simple calculator with basic arithmetic operations.
Prompt the user to input two numbers and an operation choice.
Perform the calculation and display the result.</h3></p>


<p><h3>Basic Arithmetic Operations: Implementing a calculator helps you understand and apply basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
Control Structures: You'll use control structures like loops and conditional statements to handle user input and perform calculations.</h3></p>

<p><h3>
Key Features
User Input: The calculator should accept user input for numbers and the desired operation.
Operation Selection: Users should be able to select the operation they want to perform.
Result Display: After performing the calculation, the result should be displayed to the user.
Continuous Use: You might want to allow users to perform multiple calculations without restarting the program.</h3></p>
